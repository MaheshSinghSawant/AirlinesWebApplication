        FlyDirect Airlines can arrange for wheelchair 
        transport from check-in to the boarding gate or from the aircraft to the 
        arrivals hall at your destination. Where you do not inform us in advance, we 
        will nevertheless use reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs.

        <b>Travelling with your own wheelchair:</b> </p>
    <p align="left" style="font-size: x-large">
        We are able to carry your wheelchair 
        or mobility equipment on the flight. However, there are some restrictions on 
        size and weight that you should discuss with your booking agent at the time of 
        booking. If space is available, we will store collapsible wheelchairs and 
        mobility aids in the aircraft cabin. If we cannot do this, they will be carried 
        in the hold. All wheelchairs and mobility equipment are carried free of charge 
        and do not count against the standard baggage allowance.</p>

&nbsp;During flight, the cabin pressure onboard the aircraft is equivalent to that found 
        at an altitude of approximately 5000-8000 feet. Due to this, the aircraft cabin 
        has a unique environment which may, in certain cases, lead to certain 
        physiological problems.
    </p>
    <p align="left" style="font-size: x-large">
        There is approximately 25-30% expansion of air inside the body at these cabin 
        pressures. Air at conventional cabin pressures also has less partial pressure of 
        oxygen than the air at ground level. This means that the air inside the cabin, 
        when the aircraft is cruising, is mildly hypoxic. Healthy adults and children 
        tolerate this environment very well.
