#AirlinesWebApplication

We created this application as a part of the curriculum for the certification : Microsoft Visual Studio asp.net web application developer.
The web application can be used for 
Reserving a ticket from various destinations at various dates as per the database.
The users can select the date, time, number of passengers (adults/children) and type of ticket (Business/economic).
*The name FlyDirect airlines was just used as an example and we donâ€™t intend to use it*
